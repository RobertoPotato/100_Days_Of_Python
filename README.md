#### NOTE:
Mine starts from day 20 because that's when I got the sense to use version control LOL

## DAY 20 - The old snake game
- Setting up the snake Class, drawing all its parts on the screen and 
- Making it move by responding to keyboard arrow-key presses.
- We make use of OOP concepts, creating an object of the Snake class and
having it use its defined methods to implement certain behavior like 
movement

## Day 21 - The old snake game
- Finishing up the game. Learning more OOP concepts like Inheritance
- Added logic for interacting with food, the screen's edge and own tail
- Added logic for growing after feeding
- Game over when colliding with body or screen's edge (wall)
- Learnt about array slicing

## Day 22 - Pong
- Another entry for old games, Pong
- Built on top of concepts learnt yesterday, OOP and Inheritance.
- Two players can battle it out in Pong and see who gets the most score

## Day 23 - Turtle Crossing
- This was challenging. Just thinking about it. I realize my solution was a bit
    different from the final one in the course. It works though
  
- I Opted to reset the cars back to a predefined starting position once they reached the
end of the screen, and generate a given number of cars for the game.
  
- The cars are also generated on specific "tracks" so that the player can have
  a pause if the game gets challenging
- Further improvements can include a screen where a player chooses their preferred difficulty
and this triggers generation of more or fewer cars depending on the selection
  
- I furthered my skills in OOP, especially where class inheritance is concerned.
## Day 24 - Local File operations
- Learnt to: Open, Read and Write to local files using Relative and absolute
Links in Python
  
- Applied the concepts to save and persist high scores in the previously created snake game
- Used the same skills to automate the creation of letters to be sent out as invitations
in the 'Mail Merge' project
  
- Mail merge involves reading lines of names from a file, and editing a pre-made letter, replacing
some text with the read name

## Day 25 - Working with CSVs and Pandas
- Learned how to read CSVs using pandas, and performing operations on the data. Also touched on Turtle
graphics and other previously learned concepts like lists.
- Learned how to create a new dataframe from lists, convert that to and save it as a CSV file in the computer
- Completed the US states game, and it is running fine. 

## Day 26 - Dictionary and List comprehension
- Learned about list comprehension and dictionary comprehension. These can help clean up 
code as well as reduce its complexity while doing very useful tasks. 
- Dictionary comprehension uses references for key and value, and also, the dictionary is iterated through
using a method like: dict.items()
- For looping through dataframes, pandas was used, and a CSV was imported and converted to a dataframe (df).
the df was then looped through using index and row (we were looping through rows) and nstead of the .items() method,
the iterrows() method was used.
